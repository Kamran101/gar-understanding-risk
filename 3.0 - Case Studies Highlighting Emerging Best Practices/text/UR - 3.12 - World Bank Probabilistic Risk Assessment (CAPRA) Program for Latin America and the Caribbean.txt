Urbanization in Latin America and the Caribbean has been dramatic; between 1950 and 2010, the population living in urban areas increased by approximately 600 percent. This increase is more than twice the population growth experienced in the entire region (UN-HABITAT 2010). Urbanization has resulted in a greater concentration of people and assets in areas exposed to several natural hazards, and has placed low-income groups disproportionately at risk (Lall and Deichmann 2009). By 2050, 150 million people in Latin America and the Caribbean region are expected to live in urban areas exposed to earthquakes.  

Decision makers, considering the combined effects of climate change, disaster risks, and rapid urbanization, are increasingly citing a lack of required information and awareness as a barrier to managing risk and fostering sustainable development. Indeed, among decision makers recently surveyed, 30 percent cited financial considerations as a barrier to working on climate change adaptation in their cities; 20 percent cited lack of awareness; and 20 percent cited a lack of reliable information and knowledge (Fraser and Lima 2012).

Unfortunately, national and local governments continue to face significant challenges in generating trusted, accurate, and targeted disaster risk information that can be readily understood and integrated into sustainable development and urban planning. To address these challenges, the Probabilistic Risk Assessment (CAPRA) Program was developed by the World Bank (initially as the Central America Probabilistic Risk Assessment Initiative) in partnership with the Inter-American Development Bank, the UNISDR, and CEPREDENAC (Central America Coordination Center for Natural Disaster Prevention). The case study described here focuses on the experiences and lessons learned during the implementation of Technical Assistance Projects (TAPs) carried out under the World Bank CAPRA Program from 2010 to 2013. 

During the first phase of CAPRA, which began in 2008, the activities mainly focused on developing the CAPRA software platform, a free and modular risk modelling platform, through integrating existing software and developing new modules under a unified methodological approach (see Yamin et al. 2013). As part of the development and testing of the CAPRA platform, more than 20 risk assessment exercises were undertaken in Belize, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua.<sup>46</sup> The original objective of the CAPRA Program was to transfer ownership of hazard and risk information generated by consulting firms to country governments for use in DRM policy and program design. It quickly became apparent, however, that risk information would be integrated into decision making only if government institutions were engaged more deeply and led the whole risk assessment process.

Thus in the second phase, which began in 2010, the focus of the program shifted to supporting government agencies in building their own institutional capacity to generate, manage, and use disaster risk information. This level of engagement was accomplished through the implementation of Technical Assistance Projects. Through a  partnership between government institutions and the World Bank, and with the financing of donors through the GFDRR and the Spanish Fund for Latin America and the Caribbean, technical agencies leading the development of a TAP were trained in risk modelling and analysis using the CAPRA platform, and also received technical advisory services for generating, managing, and using hazard and risk information. The scope for each TAP was defined by the needs and priorities of each of the institutions involved in the project. Under this approach, a lead government agency establishes an interdisciplinary and cross-agency team for undertaking the risk assessment and discussing the results before using the generated information to inform specific DRM policies and/or programs.

TAPs foster a hands-on approach to generating, understanding, managing, and using risk information, and thus promote ownership of the process and the results of the assessment. Between 2010 and 2013, eight TAPs were implemented in Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Panama, and Peru, each focused on answering a different risk-related question. Key features of three TAPs are described below.

///Understanding volcanic risk at Galeras Volcano (Colombia)///. Colombia has a distinguished reputation for leading efforts to reduce the impacts of disasters, with significant progress made in the last 25 years. Despite these efforts, however, many Colombian municipalities are struggling to analyze the risks from hazards such as earthquake, flood, and volcanic eruption, and as a result have difficulty investing in and implementing DRM plans and policies.  

Volcanic risk—often overlooked because eruptions are relatively infrequent, though the risk is significant for exposed populations—was prioritized by the Colombia National Planning Department for a TAP in partnership with the World Bank. Galeras Volcano, one of Colombia’s 25 active volcanoes and the focus of the TAP, poses a significant risk to neighboring towns. Three hazard zones around the volcano cover a total of 888km2. In the high-hazard zone, there is more than 20 percent probability that pyroclastic flows would completely destroy all property and kill any residents who did not evacuate. In the middle- and low-hazard zones, the probabilities are 10 percent to 20 percent and 10 percent, respectively.  

A recent cycle of volcanic activity in Galeras took place between 1987 and 2010, with eruptions in 2010 forcing the evacuation of 8,000 people. Despite this exposure, a number of municipal settlements stretch into the high-hazard zone. The Colombian government is attempting to reduce this risk through resettlement of populations living in areas at highest risk, but the success of this effort will depend on effective communication of trusted risk information. 

Starting in March 2011, the TAP aimed to complement the deterministic volcanic hazard analysis on Galeras, undertaken by the Colombia Geologic Service (Servicio Geológico Colombiano), with additional vulnerability and risk evaluation. Pyroclastic flows and volcanic ash were the focus of the modelling activity. Modelling was based on a compilation of data on historical events, a newly developed exposure database, and vulnerability functions. The exposure database included information on population, essential buildings, public services, and housing, among others, all of which was compiled into a GIS database.

The program also delivered a series of technical workshops designed to introduce specialists to the CAPRA platform and to provide hands-on training in developing and carrying out comparative analysis of the deterministic and probabilistic pyroclastic flows and volcanic ash risk assessment results. Experts in charge of monitoring the Nevado del Huila and Machín volcanoes, both of which remain active, also participated in the training activities. 

///Consolidating the national seismic hazard model and understanding the risk of earthquake to schools and hospitals in Lima (Peru)///. Peru has a long history of seismic activity, with historical records telling of an earthquake in 1582 that destroyed most of the city of Arequipa. An earthquake and associated tsunami in 1746 destroyed the city of Callao and resulted in more than 5,000 fatalities. A number of subsequent events have underscored the seismic risk in the country, with the most recent events—in 2007—causing significant damage and disrupting transportation, electrical, and communication networks.

In Peru, two TAPs since 2010 have addressed different needs. The first TAP developed a seismic hazard model at the national level and was completed in 2012. Under the second TAP, the seismic risk assessment focused on essential services and in particular on a probabilistic seismic risk assessment for schools and hospitals in the Lima Metropolitan Area. 

The national seismic hazard model was developed by a team of researchers and engineers from the National Seismological Service of the Peruvian Geophysical Institute (Instituto Geofísico del Perú). Team members collected, generated, and analyzed historical seismicity data and tectonic data, and also tested different attenuation models. These results are currently considered as key inputs into the updates of the national building codes and standards led by Peru’s National Committee for Building Codes and Norms.
  
All hazard information produced under this TAP is being integrated into the National Public Investment System (Sistema Nacional de Inversión Pública) database. This critical step facilitates the sharing of findings with the scientific community, government authorities, and the general public. This information will be essential in general urban development planning and specifically in the design and construction of infrastructure, schools, and hospitals, as well as in mining. Moreover, local engineers and researchers trained in the use of CAPRA’s seismic and tsunami hazard module<sup>47</sup> will be able to use and update the hazard model and incorporate their finding in future analysis.

Under the second TAP, a seismic probabilistic risk assessment was carried out for 1,540 schools and 42 hospitals in Lima and Callao. Currently, the results of this study are being used by the Ministry of Education to complement the countrywide infrastructure census and to design the National School Infrastructure Plan. Under this process, the World Bank is providing technical assistance to (a) extend the seismic risk assessment to other cities; (b) design a structural retrofitting program; (c) conduct a cost-benefit analysis of existing structural retrofitting alternatives; and (d) define short- and medium-term investment for the infrastructure rehabilitation.

The outcomes of the TAPs in Peru confirmed the importance of institutional engagement throughout the whole modelling process: they showed that the greater the level of engagement, the more likely it was that targeted and strategic risk information informed DRM decision making.

///Understanding and managing the risk to water and sanitation systems (Costa Rica)///. Decision makers in Costa Rica have prioritized the analysis of natural disaster impacts on infrastructure systems—that is, their focus is identifying the most vulnerable parts of a system, realistically assessing the expected damage at different locations and the impact on populations, and setting investment priorities with limited financial resources. The Costa Rican Water and Sanitation Institute (Instituto Costarricense de Acueductos y Alcantarillados) has been working in partnership with the World Bank to preserve and protect the water supply and to establish a system that restores water and sanitation as soon as possible after an earthquake. Not only does reducing interruption to water and sanitation reduce costs after an event, it can also reduce the prevalence of waterborne diseases. 

This TAP focuses on seismic risks to water and sanitation systems in the San José Metropolitan Area, the San Isidro area, and the Higuito area. Because these three systems differ in their demand levels and complexity, the project team had to consider a flexible approach that could work anywhere in Costa Rica. For example, the San José Metropolitan Area includes 1.2 million residents; draws water from riverine, spring, and artesian well sources; and has primary and secondary pipework of 570km and 2,610km, respectively, as well as numerous water treatment plants, storage tanks, and pumping stations. The San José wastewater system covers 85km of piping, pumping stations, and treatment plants. In contrast, the Higuito area is serviced by two streams, a small treatment plant, eight storage tanks, and no wastewater facilities.  

The TAP began by collecting the input data sets required to understand seismic hazard, inventorying and categorizing water and wastewater systems and components, and defining appropriate vulnerability functions. The next step was to analyze scenario earthquake events; this made it possible to understand what could happen to the system, highlight the most vulnerable sections or components, and provide estimations of the maximum probable physical and economic losses.  
These results provided a baseline for the formulation of a risk reduction program that articulated short-, medium- , and long-term investments for protecting access to water and sanitation after an earthquake. They also provide an evidence base to guide design and siting of new infrastructure. Moreover, under Presidential Decree No. 36721-MP-PLAN, CAPRA has been established as the standard tool for DRM purposes and provides for an active government-sponsored risk management approach. 

///Lessons learned from the CAPRA Program experience about effectively developing, communicating, and using risk information///. The CAPRA Program has continually evolved and developed to incorporate lessons learned about the effective development, communication, and use of risk information. Specifically, it takes into account the need for risk information to be targeted, strategic, interdisciplinary, dynamic, accessible, and formal. These characteristics are explained below.

Risk information is **targeted** and **strategic** when the scope and specific objectives of the risk assessment are consistent with the institutional needs and the surrounding context (e.g., existing programs and policies). The use of the resulting information from risk assessment will define the level of detail of the model and the resolution to be used. 

Entailing as it does the involvement of many different institutions, disaster risk assessment is a complex technical and institutional process that requires an **interdisciplinary** and cross-institutional framework. 

Risk information should be **dynamic**: it should take advantage of new available data from hazard models and should include changes in exposure from the urban environment and sectoral infrastructure. Risk information must remain **accessible** to support decision-making processes in each institution leading a risk assessment, even as institutional needs evolve. Moreover, good practice requires that the owners of the risk information clearly communicate with information users. They need to explain their understanding of the main hypothesis, limitations, and uncertainties associated with the assessment, and they need to highlight input data and information gaps and limitations in resolution (so that the assessment may be improved upon). 

Information is formal when it is generated under an established institutional and legal framework. This is a critical condition for the effective use of risk information in the design of public policies and risk reduction programs. Where information is formal and has an official and legal status, decision makers are more likely to promote its use and application for specific purposes.

Experience proves the following:

+ .When created under an official legal and institutional framework, risk information is considered legitimate for use in policy design and decision making in DRM. 
+ .When institutions participate in and lead risk assessment processes, they are more likely to take ownership of the information and to be aware of the information’s characteristics and limitations. 
+ .The formal/official dimension of risk information encourages institutional endorsement, which in turn supports links between risk management policies and policies that address the risk’s financial, social, and institutional impacts. 

The CAPRA Program has found that well-targeted programs can help individual institutions strengthen their own capacity to use risk information and take decisions around it. However, from a broader perspective, the lack of technical capacities for generating, understanding, and integrating risk information poses a complex problem. Experience in Latin America and the Caribbean reveals that government agencies and institutions need considerably more technical support in order to undertake risk assessments and produce needed risk information.
