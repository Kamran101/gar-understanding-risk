## 3-15. Reducing Seismic Risk to Public Buildings in Turkey
*/Elif Ayhan, Joaquin Toro (World Bank)/*

Seismic risk in Turkey is substantial. Estimates suggest that in the 76 earthquakes that have occurred in Turkey since 1900, 90,000 lives have been lost, 7 million people have been affected, and US$25 billion in direct damages have been incurred (Erdik 2013). The 1999 Izmit-Kocaeli and Duzce earthquakes were vivid reminders of this risk. They prompted scientific analysis that emphasized the increased risk to Istanbul arising from the nature of the North Anatolian fault zone (Parsons et al. 2000). Indeed, this analysis suggested that Istanbul’s 1 million buildings have a 2–4 percent chance of heavy damage and a 20–34 percent chance of moderate damage from a scenario earthquake event. 

In response to the heightened concern, the Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality, in cooperation with the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), prepared a microzonation study with various seismic scenarios (Pacific Consultants International et al. 2002). This analysis involved developing fundamental data sets on the seismology and ground conditions that could amplify earthquake shaking.<sup>57</sup> It also involved deriving exposure data—including data on public and private buildings, land use, hazardous facilities, lifelines, and road networks—from a variety of sources such as census and cadastral records, and then compiling them into a GIS database. Impact analyses were undertaken for four scenario earthquakes, ranging in magnitude from 6.9 to 7.7, which were selected in partnership with researchers from the Turkish scientific committee. The results suggested that 7–8 percent of buildings would have heavy damage, as many as 87,000 people would be killed, and 135,000 would be severely injured—significantly greater damage than was found by the previous analysis. The newer analysis also highlighted the vulnerability of Istanbul’s schools, hospitals, and other public buildings to earthquake shaking, and found they had a high potential for collapse.

This risk assessment made the following high-priority recommendations:

•	635 hospitals should be urgently prioritized for detailed assessment and retrofitting. 
•	Almost 2,000 schools should be urgently reviewed and retrofitted to prevent “pancake-like” collapse during an earthquake.
•	24 bridges with a high probability of collapse and two viaduct bridges should be urgently reviewed and retrofitted to prevent collapse during an earthquake. 
•	To reduce the risks of secondary fires and explosions, systems that would automatically shut down the gas distribution network after an earthquake should be considered.
•	A disaster management center should be established, and a campaign to raise awareness of disaster prevention should be conducted. 

The Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality took these recommendations into consideration in developing the Istanbul Earthquake Master Plan.<sup>58</sup> This plan was ultimately funded under a government of Turkey and World Bank risk reduction program known as Istanbul Seismic Risk Mitigation and Emergency Preparedness Project (ISMEP).<sup>59</sup>

Implementation of this program has improved emergency preparedness, reduced risk to existing public facilities, and resulted in some improvement to building code enforcement across Istanbul—achievements that have collectively increased Instanbul’s seismic resilience. Highlights of progress achieved under ISMEP by 2012 include the following:<sup>60</sup>

•	Seismic risk evaluation was carried out for 1,515 public buildings associated with 749 schools, 31 hospitals, 57 health centers, and 51 other public facilities. 
•	Work was done to retrofit or restore 658 buildings associated with 451 schools, 8 hospitals, 10 health centers, and 31 other public facilities. 
•	Reconstruction was performed for 95 schools deemed not suitable for retrofitting (where estimates gave a total retrofit cost ratio higher than 40 percent of the value of the building).
•	Inventories were made of 176 historical buildings in 26 complexes, and seismic evaluations were carried out for the Archeological Museum, Hagia Irene Museum, and Mecidiye Kiosk, including development of recommendations about structural reinforcement. 

This series of risk assessment studies, development of risk reduction plans, and implementation of investments to reduce seismic risk in Turkey constitute a remarkable example of how risk information can influence and trigger actual on-the-ground risk reduction. Turkey’s achievements came about because of (a) strong relationships between those developing the risk information and the decision makers using the information; (b) clear actionable recommendations from risk assessment; (c) strong political will to invest in risk reduction (driven by the devastation associated with the 1999 earthquakes); and (d) the prioritization of financial resources to invest in risk reduction. 

These achievements notwithstanding, seismic risk in Istanbul continues to increase—mainly because of population growth, urbanization, overcrowding, and challenges associated with enforcement of land-use plans and construction policies. Moreover, other cities in Turkey have made less progress than Istanbul in reducing seismic risk.

In light of the remaining seismic risk across the country, the government of Turkey is seeking to build on the success of the ISMEP project and extend it nationwide, focusing on public buildings (schools, hospitals, administrative buildings, emergency response centers, and other public buildings with important life-safety or emergency response functions). Given the immense scale of this task, however, robust and objective prioritization of buildings for retrofitting or reconstruction is required. 

Turkey’s Disaster and Emergency Management Presidency, with support from the World Bank and GFDRR, has developed a preliminary methodology for prioritization (World Bank 2012b). This approach involves the development of an inventory of public buildings, an evaluation of the relevant importance of different buildings, and an assessment of the elements of the building construction that make them more or less likely to be damaged in an earthquake. This broad assessment methodology is described in figure 3-20.

This methodology is used to distinguish building significance levels, which included low, moderate, significant, and high importance. Some of the attributes used to classify buildings’ importance are described in table 3-7. 

The estimation of the earthquake performance of buildings by experienced earthquake engineers was based on building geometry and number of stories; construction quality and material properties; and geotechnical and geological maps. This information is used to determine the structural vulnerability class of low, medium, or high collapse potential.<sup>61</sup>

Based on a synthesis of both these criteria, buildings for reconstruction/rebuilding were prioritized using the priorities defined in table 3-8. Under this methodology, all buildings that have a high collapse potential, irrespective of the building’s significance level as defined by its class, were allocated a priority 1 (P1). Buildings with low structural vulnerability were assigned the lowest priority, P5, except for class IV buildings, which were assigned a priority of P3.

A pilot application of this method was completed in Tokat Province of Turkey in 2013. The selection of Tokat was based on its proximity to the highly active North Anatolia fault and building stock largely characteristic of the country. Among a sample of 12 buildings, two buildings were found to be priority 1 and therefore require urgent retrofitting and/or reconstruction; one building was a priority 2, seven were priority 3 buildings, and two were priority 4 buildings. This methodology is now forming the basis for ongoing dialogue between the government of Turkey—specifically the National Disaster and Emergency Management Presidency—and the World Bank on the design of future disaster risk reduction investments.
