# Case Studies Highlighting Emerging Best Practices
Demonstrated success is one of the best ways to illustrate the benefits associated with risk assessment and show how emerging efforts can contribute to further success. This section reviews a variety of case studies describing ongoing and emerging open efforts that support risk assessments and successful examples of completed risk assessments. The contributions are roughly grouped into those focused on data; those focused on modelling; those that describe specific risk assessment projects; those that focus on participation, collaboration, and communication; and those that address the future of risk. Given that many case studies speak to some or all of these aspects, however, there is a fair amount of overlap across categories.
