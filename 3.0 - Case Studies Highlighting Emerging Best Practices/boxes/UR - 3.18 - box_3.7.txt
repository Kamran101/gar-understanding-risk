R-FONDEN: The Financial Catastrophe Risk Model of the Ministry of Finance and Public Credit in Mexico
Mexico has developed a comprehensive financial protection strategy relying on risk retention and transfer mechanisms, including reserve funds, indemnity-based reinsurance, parametric insurance, and catastrophe bonds. An in-depth understanding of the risks has allowed the Mexican government to successfully access international reinsurance and capital markets to transfer specific risks.
A fundamental feature of the strategy is the R-FONDEN, a probabilistic catastrophe risk assessment platform developed to estimate the government’s financial exposure. R-FONDEN offers scenario-based as well as probabilistic analysis at national, state, and sub-state levels of four major perils (earthquake, floods, tropical cyclones, and storm surge) for infrastructure in key sectors (education, health, roads, and low-income housing).R-FONDEN takes as input a detailed exposure database (with information on buildings, roads, and other public assets) and produces as outputs risk metrics such as annual expected loss (AEL) and probable maximum loss (PML). This model is currently used by the Ministry of Finance, in combination with actuarial analysis of historical loss data, to monitor the disaster risk exposure on FONDEN’s portfolio and to design risk transfer strategies.
