Typhoon Yolanda GeoNode: An Example of the Collaborative Effort Possible under OpenDRI

Super Typhoon Yolanda (international name Haiyan), with 305km/hr sustained winds and 6m storm surge, made landfall in Guiuan (central Philippines) in November 2013 as one of the strongest cyclones on record. Yolanda subsequently made landfall on four more islands before heading back to sea and weakening into a tropical storm, eventually dissipating over China. 

Damage across the central Philippines was severe. UN agencies estimate that approximately 11 million people were displaced and over 6,200 killed. Entire sections of cities were leveled by wind and water. Understanding the extent and magnitude of the damage was core to both the response effort and the planning for recovery and reconstruction. 

Working together, the geographic information system (GIS) team from the American Red Cross’s International Department and the team from the GFDRR Labs set up a GeoNode data catalog to collect all geospatial data that were technically and legally open. Over the course of three weeks, the Yolanda GeoNode team collected over 72 layers of geospatial data, including damage assessments performed by the EU Joint Research Centre, UNOSAT, the U.S. National Geospatial Intelligence, and the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap team. The GeoNode also hosted hundreds of situation reports and PDFs from the Red Cross and United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), many of which contained geospatial data. Importantly, the GeoNode also collated data from collective efforts of the OSM community, which made over 4.5 million edits from 1,600 mappers working from 82 countries. 

A technical team—BoundlessGeo and LMN Solutions, working under the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers—developed a technique to extract footprints of damaged buildings from these OSM data, placed them under version control in a tool called GeoGit, and made daily snapshots available. In the process, the technical team prototyped new approaches to tracking the growing volumes of damage assessment data generated by the OSM community. This technique will continue to be explored for future efforts.

The Yolanda GeoNode is an example of a GeoNode for a specific event. This approach can be used to make specific subsets of data available to a community that needs them to support the specialized use cases of response operations and recovery planning. Over the long term, the data in event GeoNodes can be rolled back into national GeoNodes or databases, allowing agencies to curate data for their general operations. This scenario recently played out with haitidata.org, which has been transferred to national government ownership. 

Information hosted on GeoNode, in combination with hazard and exposure data produced in the last 10 years, including a high-resolution risk assessment for disaster risk and financing purposes produced in 2013, is now being used to inform recovery and reconstruction in the Philippines.
