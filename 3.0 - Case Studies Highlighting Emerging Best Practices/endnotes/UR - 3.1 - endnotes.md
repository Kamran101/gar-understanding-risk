<sup>23</sup>In the 20th century alone, over 11,000 people lost their lives to earthquakes in Nepal. The 1934 Bihar-Nepal earthquake destroyed 20 percent of Kathmandu’s building stock and damaged 40 percent.

<sup>29</sup>GMMA RAP was a component of BRACE (Building the Resilience and Awareness of Metro Manila Communities to Natural Disaster and Climate Change Impacts), an Australian aid program in the Philippines initiated in 2010 that sought to reduce the vulnerability and enhance the resilience of Metro Manila and selected neighboring areas to the impacts of natural disasters and climate change. As a component of the BRACE program, GMMA RAP is also known as the Enhancing Risk Analysis Capacities for Flood, Tropical Cyclone Severe Wind, and Earthquake for Greater Metro Manila Area program.

<sup>30</sup>This project was the joint Geoscience Australia/PHIVOLCS (Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology) pilot study of earthquake risk in Iloilo City, in the Western Visayas region of the Philippines (see Bautista et al. 2012).

<sup>32</sup>This paper draws in part on Petiteville, Bally, and Seguin (2012).

<sup>36</sup>The International Centre for Water Hazard and Risk Management (ICHARM) operates under the auspices of UNESCO and the Public Works Research Institute, Japan. The authors would like to express their sincere appreciation to the following for their valuable inputs: Dr. Satoru Nishikawa (special representative of the Secretary-General for DRR on the Post-2015 Framework for DRR and the Global Platform); Mr. Yusuke Amano (Water and Disaster Management Bureau, Japan); and Dr. Yuki Matsuoka (UNISDR Hyogo Office). We are also indebted to the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration and the Asian Disaster Preparedness Center for providing their data and comments.

<sup>37</sup>For the sake of brevity, the discussion here will focus on the risk of fatality-causing floods.

<sup>38</sup>Such a conceptual approach uses hazard, exposure, and vulnerability indices to assign data to various categories. For each category, a score is derived by arithmetic computations, such as by using the weighted rank sum method. A conceptual risk index is finally presented on a 0 to 1 scale by summing the scores.

<sup>39</sup>Only the effectiveness of the levee with respect to overflow is considered. Breaching of levees is not considered in this analysis. This may underestimate the calculated inundation extend and the water depths of the flood when levees are included in the calculation.

<sup>50</sup>This phase produced social and economic vulnerability assessment reports as follows: a synthesis report, a methodological description, and 10 detailed island reports.

<sup>53</sup>Note that for the purposes of analysis flood defenses were assumed to be not effective due to insufficient maintenance.
