## About This Publication
This publication was developed to help identify the progress made in risk assessment under the 10-year Hyogo Framework for Action and to capture through use-case analysis the diverse efforts made to improve our awareness and understanding of risk. It is not a technical guide on how to undertake a risk assessment and instead offers a narrative to a nontechnical audience interested in how risk information can lead to more resilient communities, cities, and countries. The authors are aware that this publication does not capture all the engagements and projects on risk assessment across the globe or all the innovations and advances that have taken place. However, it does provide both a snapshot of use cases for those interested in application of risk assessment and some recommendations for the future.

The report begins with an overview and is then divided in four parts.
