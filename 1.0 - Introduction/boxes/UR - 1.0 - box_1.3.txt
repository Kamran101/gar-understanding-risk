### Community Mapping in Indonesia
Open data initiatives, combined with bottom-up approaches such as citizen mapping initiatives, can be an effective way to build large exposure databases.
The Community Mapping for Resilience program in Indonesia is an example of a large-scale exposure data collection system. The program began in 2011 through a partnership led by the Australia-Indonesia Facility for Disaster Reduction, Indonesia’s National Disaster Management Agency (Badan Nasional Penanggulangan Bencana), and the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT), with support from the Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery and the World Bank.
The initiative’s main goal is to use OpenStreetMap to collect building-level exposure data for risk assessment applications. OpenStreetMap offers several important features: open source tools for online or offline mapping, a platform for uploading and hosting data with free and open access, and an active global community of users.
In a little over a year, more than 160,000 individual buildings were mapped and new partners— including five of Indonesia’s largest universities, local government agencies, international development partners such as Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit GmbH (GIZ), and civil society organizations—were trained and are using the platform.
