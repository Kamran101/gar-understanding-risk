### How Risk Information Contributes to Mainstreaming of DRM in World Bank Group OperationsRecognizing that the risks from adverse natural events challenge its efforts to end extreme poverty and promote shared prosperity, the World Bank Group now has disaster and climate risk management at the core of its strategy.  Moreover, under the IDA17 program of the International Development Association (the World Bank’s fund for the poorest countries), the World Bank Group has committed to incorporating climate and disaster risk considerations in all new country partnership frameworks and will screen all International Development Association operations for climate and disaster risks. To carry out this strategy of mainstreaming disaster and climate risk management into World Bank Group operations, an even greater investment and focus on risk identification will be required. The World Bank’s investment in DRM is steadily rising. It grew from US$2 billion in fiscal year 2010 to US$3.8 billion in fiscal year 2013, with the most substantial growth in Africa. The large share of this investment&mdash;83 percent&mdash;supports ex ante DRM activities. The role of advisory and analytical services to support better information on natural hazard risk is also growing; in the last three years, 43 countries have been supported in efforts to improve their information about hazard exposure. To cite one example: the Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery (GFDRR) supported analytical work on seismic and flood risk in Manila, which has led the Philippine government to endorse a US$9 billion flood reduction plan. This report offers further examples of efforts by the World Bank and GFDRR to implement risk assessment as the first step toward reducing risk through DRM. __Source: Development Committee 2014.__
