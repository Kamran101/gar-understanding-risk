### Defining “Open”
The members of the Global Earthquake Model, a public-private partnership, share an interest in credible, accessible risk information that is widely used and understood. Although the principle of “open” data was central to GEM’s mission and self-understanding, over the course of GEM’s first six years members differed widely on what “open” meant and implied.
These differences became obvious and somewhat contentious when concrete licensing policies were proposed for the data and software developed under GEM: public sector participants typically viewed “open” to imply “free of charge,” while private sector participants, who sought an ongoing business advantage from their sponsorship of GEM, did not want GEM data and software to be made available free of charge to their competitors. In their view, “open” did not necessarily entail “free.” 
 GEM’s governing board convened a task group to study this issue further and make a recommendation to the board. The task group, made up of seven members representing both the public and private sector, proposed a compromise: data and model licenses would be embargoed for 18 months. Under this arrangement, GEM initially releases any given version of a GEM data set or model with a license restricting commercial use for 18 months;a after this period the same product is rereleased under a license without commercial restriction.a.
