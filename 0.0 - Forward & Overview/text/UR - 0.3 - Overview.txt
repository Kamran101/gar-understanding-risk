The 10-year-long Hyogo Framework for Action (HFA) set out to substantially reduce impacts from natural disasters by 2015. Despite efforts toward this goal, economic losses from natural disasters are rising&mdash;from $50 billion each year in the 1980s, to just under $200 billion each year in the last decade (World Bank and GFDRR 2013). The economic losses sustained by lower- and middle-income countries alone over the last 30 years represent a full third of all total development assistance in the same time period, offsetting tremendous efforts by governments, multilateral organizations, and other actors.

As the HFA period ends against a backdrop of challenging disaster risk trends, and consultations toward a post-2015 framework move forward, it is important to reflect on the role of disaster risk assessments in achieving disaster and climate resilience, and on the contributions risk assessments have made over the last 10 years. Understanding Risk: The Evolution of Disaster Risk Assessment, which was developed to inform post-HFA discussions and the 2015 Global Assessment Report on Disaster Risk Reduction (GAR)<sup>1</sup>,  reports on the current state of the practice of risk assessment and on advances made over the last decade.

<<col>>Across the globe, emerging consensus is highlighting the central importance of risk information in disaster risk management (DRM): 

<blockquote>The foundation for DRM is understanding the hazards, and the exposure and vulnerability of people and assets to those hazards. By quantifying the risks and anticipating the potential impacts of hazards, governments, communities, and individuals can make informed prevention decisions. Such information can be used to set priorities for development and adaptation strategies, sector plans, programs, projects, and budgets. (World Bank 2012, 5)</blockquote>

This report contains case studies spanning 40 countries that showcase emerging best practices, demonstrate how risk assessments are being used to inform DRM and broader development, and highlight lessons learned through these efforts. Taken as a group, these case studies evidence the need for continued investment in accurate and useful risk information and provide recommendations for the future.  
Experience has shown that a purely technical assessment of risk, however sophisticated and cutting-edge, is by itself unlikely to trigger actions that reduce risk. Successful risk assessments produce information that is targeted, authoritative, understandable, and usable. Thus the first steps in a risk assessment include understanding why the assessment is needed and wanted, defining the information gaps that currently prevent DRM actions, and identifying the end-users of the information. These steps can be completed only if the process of generating and using risk information is integrated with institutional processes, and if there is communication and trust among all involved parties: scientists, engineers, decision makers, governmental authorities, and community representatives. A risk assessment designed along these lines will enable the development of information useful for risk mitigation. 

But it is also important to recognize that understanding risk is more than just modelling risk; it requires an understanding of the development and social processes that underlie and drive the generation of disaster risk, such as the political and social nature of disaster risk information and its use. For example, the decision of an individual or government to construct a building that is resilient to seismic events will be a result of a complex interplay between awareness of, belief in, and acceptance of the potential risks; the financial and technical capacity to design and construct the resilient structure; and the appropriate (enforced) legal, institutional, and regulatory framework (e.g., enforcement of building codes). Similarly, land scarcity in rapidly developing urban environments forces often uncomfortable trade-offs between the urgent needs of today, such as the need to build on vacant land near employment and educational opportunities, and the potential risks of tomorrow, such as a 1-in-20-year flood event.

Moreover, from a public policy perspective, risk information can be sensitive information, as it requires&mdash;government officials, private sector companies, community, or individual&mdash;to decide on action (or inaction) to reduce the impacts of a potential hazardous event. The decision&mdash;for example, to relocate communities away from high flood risk areas&mdash;will come with explicit (e.g., financial/resource) costs and implicit (e.g., political and/or social capital) costs, all of which have to be weighed within a broader context. The chance of risk information translating into action, then, depends to a large extent on sensitive negotiations between public officials, affected communities, and financial providers. Hence the importance of authoritative information, which can be fit into a regulated framework backed by the necessary legal and institutional context.

This publication is not a "how-to" guide for risk assessment, nor does it provide a technical articulation of the risk assessment process. Rather, it provides insight into the potential richness and range of risk assessment approaches and their capacity to meet a variety of purposes and contexts within the same overarching framework. For scientists, engineers, and others producing risk information, the publication highlights some of the challenges in understanding risk&mdash;beyond the strictly technical aspects that are described in many other publications.

## Risk Information as the Basis for Decision Making 
Risk information provides a critical foundation for managing disaster risk across a wide range of sectors. In the insurance sector, the quantification of disaster risk is essential, given that the solvency capital of most non-life insurance companies is strongly influenced by their exposure to natural catastrophe risk. In the construction sector, quantifying the potential risk expected in the lifetime of a building, bridge, or critical facility drives the creation and modification of building codes. In the land-use and urban planning sectors, robust analysis of flood risk likewise drives investment in flood protection and possibly effects changes in insurance as well. At the community level, an understanding of hazard events&mdash;whether from living memory or oral and written histories&mdash;can inform and influence decisions on preparedness, including life-saving evacuation procedures and the location of important facilities.  

Building on the DRM framework proposed in the Sendai report (World Bank 2012), we highlight here the role of risk identification in five key areas of decision making. Each of the case studies included in this publication deals with the planning, development, and application of risk information for at least one of these areas. 

1. .__Risk identification: Understanding, communicating, and raising awareness of disaster risk.__ Managing disaster risk is just one of myriad challenges faced by governments, communities, and individuals, and it is one that may be easy to neglect. Because the damages and losses caused by historical disasters are often not widely known, and because the potential damages and losses that could arise from future disasters (including infrequent but high-impact events) may not be known at all, DRM is given a low priority. Appropriate communication of robust risk information at the right time can raise awareness and trigger action. 
2. .__Risk reduction: Informing policies, investments, and structural and nonstructural measures intended to reduce risk.__ Hazard and risk information may be used to inform a broad range of activities to reduce risk, from improving building codes and designing risk reduction measures (such as flood and storm surge protection), to carrying out macro-level assessments of the risks to different types of buildings (for prioritizing investment in reconstruction and retrofitting, for example).  
3. .__Preparedness: Informing early warning systems and emergency measures and supporting preparedness and contingency planning at various levels.__ An understanding of the geographic area affected, along with the intensity and frequency of different hazard events, is critical for planning evacuation routes, creating shelters, and running preparedness drills. Providing a measure of the impact of different hazard events&mdash;potential number of damaged buildings, fatalities and injuries, secondary hazards&mdash;makes it possible to establish detailed and realistic plans for better response to disasters, which can ultimately reduce the severity of adverse natural events. 
4. .__Financial protection: Developing financial applications to manage and/or transfer risk.__ Disaster risk analysis was born out of the financial and insurance sector’s need to quantify the risk of comparatively rare high-impact natural hazard events. As governments increasingly seek to manage their sovereign financial risk or support programs that manage individual financial risks (e.g., micro-insurance or household earthquake insurance), developing new risk information is critical. It is important to recognize that investment in risk information for insurance or financial purposes is typically resource-intensive and needs to adhere to specific standards of analysis. 
5. .__Resilient reconstruction: Informing early and rapid estimates of damage and providing critical information for reconstruction.__ Risk assessment can play a critical role in impact modelling before an event strikes (in the days leading up to a cyclone, for example), or it can provide initial and rapid estimates of human, physical, and economic loss in an event’s immediate aftermath. Moreover, risk information for resilient reconstruction needs to be available before an event occurs, since after the event there is rarely time to collect the information needed to inform resilient design and land-use plans.

## A Framework for Quantifying and Understanding Risk
In its most simple form, disaster risk is a function of three components&mdash;hazard, exposure, and vulnerability (figure O-1). 

+ .__Hazard__ refers to the likelihood and intensity of a potentially destructive natural phenomenon, such as ground shaking induced by an earthquake or wind speed associated with a tropical cyclone. 
+ .__Exposure__ refers to the location, attributes, and value of assets that are important to the various communities, such as people, buildings, factories, farmland, and infrastructure, and that are exposed to the hazard. 
+ .__Vulnerability__ is the reaction of the assets when exposed to the spatially variable forces produced by a hazard event. For example, a building’s vulnerability to earthquake increases with the intensity of ground shaking and decreases with improved conformity to seismic design standards. Similarly, socioeconomic conditions can make responding to a hazard event easier or more difficult. 

Of course, within this simple framework a multitude of possible approaches to risk assessment and risk modelling is possible.

It is important to emphasize that exposure and vulnerability, not just hazard level, drive the scale and impacts of any disaster (figure O-2). Rapid and/or unplanned urbanization&mdash;characterized by dense populations living in poorly constructed housing&mdash;sets the stage for significant losses in lives and property when it occurs in areas at risk of flooding, earthquake, or other hazards. Indeed, evidence now points to urbanization&mdash;the unplanned and unchecked swelling of cities and megacities&mdash;as among the most important drivers of disaster risk (GFDRR 2012). Fortunately, a catastrophic disaster is not the inevitable consequence of a hazard event, and much can be done to reduce the exposure and vulnerability of populations living in areas where natural hazards occur, whether frequently or infrequently.

The two strongest tropical cyclones ever to strike India constitute an instructive example of what can be achieved through understanding and managing risk. In 1999, the Odisha cyclone made landfall and resulted in 10,000 fatalities.<sup>2</sup>  Fourteen years later, Cyclone Phailin struck nearby and resulted in 45 fatalities.<sup>3</sup>  This dramatic reduction in loss of life highlights the extensive efforts made by the state of Odisha in disaster management and preparedness. A similar example is offered by New Zealand and Japan, where efforts by governments over decades massively reduced potential losses from the Christchurch and Great East Japan (Tohoku) earthquake events in 2011.

## Advances in Disaster Risk Assessment and Key Remaining Challenges
Though important challenges remain in assessing risk, since 2005 significant progress has been made on each critical element of the risk assessment process. More hazard data and models are available; tools and models for identifying, analyzing, and managing risk have grown in number and utility; and risk data and tools are increasingly being made freely available to users as part of a larger global trend toward open data. More generally, and in contrast to 2005, today there is a deeper understanding&mdash;on the part of governments as well as development institutions such as the World Bank&mdash;that risk must be managed on an ongoing basis,<sup>4</sup>  and that DRM requires many partners working cooperatively and sharing information.

This section summarizes technical advances and challenges associated with the fundamental elements of risk&mdash;hazard, exposure, vulnerability, and the modelling that integrates these components&mdash;as well as operational and institutional progress and challenges associated with new modes of addressing risk such as multi-stakeholder collaboration, communication, and open data and models.

///Hazard./// A wide range of data is required for understanding the potential extent and intensity of one or more natural hazards. In the last Dec.ade, there has been substantial progress toward creating and providing open access to many global and national data sets critical to understanding hazard. Moreover, significant advances have been made in generation of so-called synthetic catalogs of hazard events, which are used to ensure that the full range of hazard events is captured and the likelihood of different events assigned. Significant challenges in acquiring and using hazard data remain, however. Consensus is emerging on the urgent need, particularly in developing countries and high-risk coastal areas, for digital elevation data at the appropriate level (that is, better than the 90m resolution that is currently available). Similarly, lack of historical hydrometeorological data in digital format poses significant challenges in quantifying current and future hydrometeorological risk in low- to middle-income countries. There is also evidence of emerging attempts to integrate climate change scenarios into risk modelling; however, this adds significant additional uncertainty into the modelled results.

///Exposure./// The growing momentum in efforts to develop exposure data has given rise to new approaches to data collection at various scales, from global to individual-building level. The greater availability of global data sets on population, building types, satellite imagery, and so on is providing significant opportunity to model global exposure at higher and higher resolutions. At national and subnational levels, data and information from government ministries (such as statistics authorities, transportation and infrastructure departments, and education and health departments) are increasingly being liberated  and merged in order to understand community, city, and national exposure. At city and community levels, the growing popularity of volunteer geospatial initiatives (e.g., OpenStreetMap, or OSM&mdash;see Box 2) is seen by authorities as a way to engage communities, particularly youth, in the collection of data that will help everyone to plan and manage disaster risk. The Community Mapping for Resilience program in Indonesia<sup>6</sup>  is a prime example of a government-led volunteer geospatial initiative: in a little over a year, more than 160,000 individual buildings were mapped into OSM.

Underpinning these efforts has been the rapid rise of the open data movement, which aims to make data technically open.<sup>7</sup>  The Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery and World Bank launched the Open Data for Resilience Initiative in 2011 to foster and catalyze the open data movement for climate and disaster resilience. Under this initiative, web-based geospatial platforms (GeoNodes) in more than 20 countries have been used to open more than 1,000 geospatial data sets to the public and to catalyze community mapping of buildings and infrastructure. (For more on the development and use of GeoNodes, see box 3-1 and section 3-1.) Moreover, satellite imagery is increasingly becoming available for use in assessing and understanding risk. Meteorological data collected using satellite imagery, for example, are increasingly being used to determine flood and drought risks at global and national scales. In addition, release of satellite imagery to the crowd is increasingly being used to map building footprints, roads, and other characteristics of the built environment or disaster-impacted area&mdash;often by mappers thousands of kilometers away. However, all these efforts need to achieve scale and sustainability to ensure that exposure data are available to explain the impacts of disasters and climate change at different scales.

///Vulnerability./// Both structural (i.e., physical) vulnerability and socioeconomic vulnerability are relevant to risk assessment. Concerning structural vulnerability, local engineers are increasingly dedicating themselves to understanding the vulnerability of their local building stock (which varies significantly from country to country and within countries) to different natural hazards. Engineers in the Philippines and Indonesia, for instance, are now developing vulnerability functions relevant to their respective national building stocks. However, opportunities continue to be lost in the collection of damage and loss data following disaster events&mdash;data and information critical to understanding future risks. In addition, efforts to quantify socioeconomic vulnerability and poverty remain limited, and information of this kind is rarely integrated into risk assessments. 

///Risk modelling./// The last decade has seen a revolution in open access hazard and risk modelling software packages. Users from beginner to expert can now choose from a range of tools to address a range of problems. The packages vary in complexity from OpenQuake, which is designed for highly advanced users, to multi-hazard risk platforms such as CAPRA, to tools that enable nonspecialists to interact with data sets produced by both experts and volunteers, such as InaSAFE (described in detail in section 3-22).<sup>8</sup>  All these advances and innovations create a need for better standards and transparency, which would enable replicating risk results by other actors, reporting on modelling assumptions and uncertainty, and so forth.

Another area of increased research and innovation has been global and regional risk modelling activities, designed to provide insight into global and regional trends in disaster risk. For example, global flood risk models developed in recent years can quickly provide estimations of potential losses&mdash;in monetary or human terms&mdash;from flood events with different return periods. With these advances comes a need for clear communication of the limitations of global analysis, in terms of scale, data, and assumptions (e.g., global and regional flood models rarely integrate information on flood protection). While the experts developing these models clearly understand their limitations, especially at subnational levels, those using the information produced by these models may understand their limitations less well.
It is well recognized that risk is not static and that it can change very rapidly as a result of evolving hazard, exposure, and vulnerability (recall figure O-2). Decision makers therefore need to engage today on the risk they face tomorrow. Fortunately, significant new methodologies and data sets are being developed that will increasingly make modelling future risks possible.

///Multi-institutional collaboration./// Risk assessment is inherently multi-institutional, and no single agency can be solely responsible for generating, communicating, and using risk information. The opportunities for collaboration and dialogue among multi-institutional stakeholders are evident in recent successful efforts in countries such as Jordan (see section 3-10), the Philippines (sections 3-1 and 3-4), Indonesia (section 3-4), and Bangladesh (section 3-2 and box 2-13), where agencies responsible for each element of risk assessment worked together with decision makers in finance, planning, and emergency management. Moreover, a number of global collaborative efforts have been formed to bring together practitioners from public, private, academic, and nongovernmental organizations; an example is the Understanding Risk global community of practice (see box 2-11). What the case studies make clear in aggregate is that there is no singular "correct" formula for building multi-institutional collaborations around risk assessment; effective approaches are context specific, build on existing institutional mandates, and center on the specific DRM problem being addressed. 

///Risk communication./// The delivery of a risk assessment is now widely recognized as a first step. The completion of the risk assessment marks the beginning of a longer process of broadly communicating risk information to all relevant stakeholders&mdash;in a way that is meaningful to them and fit for their purposes. There is no one right way to communicate risk; instead practitioners need to draw on a toolbox of approaches, ranging from Excel spreadsheets, maps, and simple interactive tools, to graphical representation of hazard and risk, to clear action-orientated messages from authoritative and respected voices explaining what citizens, communities, and countries can do to reduce risk. Much progress has been made in communicating risk&mdash;the Padang Build Back Better campaign described in section 3-21 demonstrates this fact, as does the growing use of new interactive geospatial tools such as GeoNode and InaSAFE&mdash;but this is an area that needs substantial additional investment in practical and considered research.

///Recommendations for Future Risk Assessments///
The recommendations we offer here draw on submissions to this publication and on discussions with both users and developers of risk information. For users of risk information&mdash;DRM practitioners, government officials, donors, and nongovernmental organizations considering investing in risk assessment&mdash;our key recommendations are meant to ensure that such investment promotes more resilient development and communities. For those undertaking risk analyses, we see an opportunity to promote greater transparency and accountability. We stress, however, that the best outcomes are likely to be achieved when those investing in risk information and those carrying out the risk analysis work in concert and share a common understanding of the undertaking. 
<br />
1. .///Clearly define the purpose of the risk assessment before analysis starts./// Risk assessments initiated without first defining a question and an end-user often become scientific and engineering exercises that upon completion must find a use case. Moreover, a risk assessment that is not properly targeted may not be fit for its intended purpose or may be over-engineered and/or over-resourced. Where risk assessments have been commissioned in response to a clear and specific request for information, they have tended to be effective in reducing fiscal or physical risk.

2. .///Promote and enable ownership of the risk assessment process and efforts to mitigate risk./// Ownership is critical for ensuring that knowledge created through a risk assessment is authoritative and therefore acted upon. It is certainly possible for risk specialists to generate risk analysis without ever engaging with local authorities; but regardless of the sophistication or accuracy of their analysis, there will likely be very limited uptake of this information. Experience shows that successful projects often partner risk specialists with country counterparts to design, implement, and communicate the results of the risk assessment. Now that citizens have the ability to map entire cities, it is also important to recognize that the data they generate are more likely to be used when the authorities are also engaged in this process.

3. .///Cultivate and promote the generation and use of open data./// Experience gained in the last decade strongly speaks to the need to encourage the creation and use of open data. The analysis of natural hazards and their risks is a highly resource- and data-intensive process, whereby the return on expended resources (time and money) can be maximized if the data are created once and used often, and if they are iteratively improved. Current approaches to developing open exposure data on the location, type, and value of assets continue to be improved, and volunteered geospatial efforts and remote sensing products offer new opportunities to collect and update fundamental data. That said, despite the progress made, some fundamental data gaps prohibit meaningful and accurate assessments of disaster and climate risks&mdash;for example, we lack global digital elevation data sets available at resolutions appropriate for analyzing the potential inundation from flood, storm surge, sea-level rise, tsunami, and so on.
<<col>>
4. .///Make better communication of risk information an urgent priority./// Clear communication throughout the risk assessment process&mdash;from initiation of the assessment to delivery of results and the development of plans in response&mdash;is critical for successfully mitigating disaster risk.<br />A case study featured in section 3-21&mdash;"Build Back Better: Where Knowledge Is Not Enough"&mdash;is a must-read for all risk assessment practitioners and disaster risk managers. An exceptionally planned and implemented "Build Back Better" campaign led by the government of Indonesia in the aftermath of the 2009 Padang earthquake demonstrated conclusively that well-targeted education and communication of risk information can increase awareness of natural hazards and their potential impacts. Analysis also showed, however, that progress from increased awareness to action can be very difficult to achieve, even in a community that has witnessed at first hand the devastation of an earthquake. To put risk knowledge into practice and build more resilient homes, people must be offered the correct combination of timely information, technical training, community supervision, and financial and nonfinancial incentives and disincentives.<br />A second point about communicating risk information has to do with the type of information communicated, and to whom. Metrics like average annual loss and probable maximum loss, for example, are of interest and relevant to the financial sector, but they are poor metrics for communicating with almost all other decision makers involved in DRM. Far preferable are interactive tools that enable people to answer "what if?" questions robustly and simply ("What if an earthquake/cyclone/other natural hazard hit my community&mdash;How many buildings would collapse or be damaged?"). InaSAFE, a recently developed tool, meets this need and is now being used extensively at national and subnational levels in Indonesia. That said, there is still immense opportunity to develop a bigger toolbox of interactive, highly graphical visualization tools, which would enable all decision makers, from individuals to national governments, to meaningfully interact with risk information.

5. .///Foster multidisciplinary, multi-institutional, and multi-sectoral collaboration at all levels, from international to community. ///To generate a usable risk assessment product, technical experts and decision makers must consult with one another and reach agreement on the risk information that is required by the relevant development program, and more broadly on the purpose and process of the risk assessment. The actual development of risk information is clearly a multidisciplinary effort that takes place through collaborations ranging from international efforts to multi-institutional arrangements at national and subnational levels. There are many efforts currently under way that speak to the success of this approach. However, success has been comparatively limited in merging community-level understanding of risk with a national or subnational understanding of risk. This is a missed opportunity wherein a common understanding of the risks and necessary steps to reduce these risks could trigger greater action. 

6. .///Consider the broader risk context./// Rarely do countries, communities, or citizens face potential risks from only one hazard, or even from natural hazards alone. Our complex environments and social structures are such that multiple or connected risks&mdash;from financial hazards, multiple or cascading natural hazards, and anthropogenic hazards&mdash;are the norm. Just as multi-peril risk calculations are required for many financial applications, territorial planning should draw on information from assessments of multiple hazards (flood, landslide, and earthquake, for example) in order to reduce risk. We know that failure to consider the full hazard environment can result in maladaptation (heavy concrete structures with a ground-level soft story for parking can protect against cyclone wind, for example, but can be deadly in an earthquake), whereas adopting a multi-hazard risk approach leads to better land-use planning, better response capacity, greater risk awareness, and increased ability to set priorities for mitigation actions. Particular caution should be taken with risks in food security and the agricultural sector, and we recommend that these risks be considered alongside flood and drought analysis.

7. .///Keep abreast of evolving risk./// Risk assessments need to account for temporal and spatial changes in hazard, exposure, and vulnerability, particularly in rapidly urbanizing areas or where climate change impacts will be felt the most. A risk assessment that provides an estimation of evolving or future risk is a way to engage stakeholders in carrying out actions now in order to avoid or mitigate the risk that is accumulating in their city or country. For example, risk analysis offers an opportunity to quantify the decrease in future risk that arises from better enforcement of building codes, and hence to demonstrate the benefit of spending additional funds on building code enforcement.<br />Because risk is likely to evolve under climate change&mdash;according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, "a changing climate leads to changes in the frequency, intensity, spatial extent, duration, and timing of extreme weather and climate events" (IPCC 2012, 7)&mdash;there is increasing interest in understanding climate change’s impacts and calculating losses under future adverse climate events. Using the modelling techniques and approaches developed to model disaster risk, experts have demonstrated the potential to determine future loss under climate change. However, since the fundamental data sets that enable the risks of today to be quantified are the same as those required to determine the impacts of adverse events in the future, it is critical for both the disaster and climate change communities to continue investing in fundamental data and innovation. 

8. .///Understand, quantify, and communicate the uncertainties and limitations of risk information./// Once risk information is produced, all users must be aware of and knowledgeable about its limitations and uncertainties, which can arise from uncertainties in the exposure data, in knowledge of the hazard, and in knowledge of fragility and vulnerability functions. Failure to consider these can lead to flawed decision making and inadvertently increase risk. A risk model can produce a very precise result&mdash;it may show, for example, that a 1-in-100-year flood will affect 388,123 people&mdash;but in reality the accuracy of the model and input data may provide only an order of magnitude estimate. Similarly, sharply delineated flood zones on a hazard map do not adequately reflect the uncertainty associated with the estimate and could lead to decisions such as locating critical facilities just outside the "flood line," where the actual risk is the same as if the facility was located inside the flood zone. It is incumbent upon specialists producing risk information to clearly and simply communicate uncertainties and limitations.
<<col>>
9. .///Ensure that risk information is credible and transparent./// Risk information must be scientifically and technically rigorous, open for review, and honest regarding its limitations and uncertainties, which may arise from uncertainties in the exposure data, in knowledge of the hazard, and in knowledge of fragility and vulnerability functions. The best way to demonstrate credibility is to have transparent data, models, and results open for review by independent, technically competent individuals. Risk modelling has become very advanced, yet also more accessible, and therefore anyone can feasibly run a risk model&mdash;but without the appropriate scientific and engineering training and judgment, the results may be fundamentally incorrect and may mislead decision makers.  

10. .///Encourage innovations in open source software./// In the last 5 to 10 years, immense progress has been made in creating new open source hazard and risk modelling software. More than 80 freely available software packages, many of which are open source, are now available for flood, tsunami, cyclone (wind and surge), and earthquake, with at least 30 of these in widespread use. Significant progress has also been made in improving open source geospatial tools, such as QGIS and GeoNode, which are lowering the financial barriers to understanding risks at national and subnational levels. Yet all this innovation has created challenges around assessing "fitness-for-purpose," interoperability, transparency, and standards. These need to be addressed in a way that continues to catalyze innovation and yet also better supports risk model users.

## Recommendations toward the Next Hyogo Framework for Action
Looking ahead to the next phase of the HFA, we would encourage international policy makers to consider the above recommendations, which are based on the case studies and analytical work this publication reports on. Future HFA indicators centered on risk information should articulate the need for targeted, robust, authoritative, trusted, open, understandable, and usable risk information&mdash;descriptors which were universally mentioned by contributors to this publication. Future HFA indicators should also stress the importance of producing risk information that is driven by the needs of end-users and the information and evidence gaps&mdash;whether at national, subnational or community levels&mdash;as well as the need for appropriate communication of risk information for different stakeholders.
