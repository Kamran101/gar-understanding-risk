## <a name="summary"><a/>Summary

The purpose of this document is to provide instruction and information into the structure and management of the GAR Reports.

## <a name="folder-structure"><a/>Folder Structure

The folders in this repository are structured in a way to make merging documents with the final Indesign file as simple as possible. Each text item is separated into sections so they can be linked and placed within the Indesign file and allow for a consistent structure that will allow you to continue editing the files, and allow us to typeset without needing to worry about any edits or changes you need to make to the text. This will also ensure we all have the latest version of the document for typesetting and editing.
