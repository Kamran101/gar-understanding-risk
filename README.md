## <a name="summary"><a/>Summary

The purpose of this document is to provide instruction and information into the structure and management of the GAR Reports.

## <a name="folder-structure"><a/>Folder Structure

The folders in this repository are structured in a way to make merging documents with the final Indesign file as simple as possible. Each text item is separated into sections so they can be linked and placed within the Indesign file and allow for a consistent structure that will allow you to continue editing the files, and allow us to typeset without needing to worry about any edits or changes you need to make to the text. This will also ensure we all have the latest version of the document for typesetting and editing.

## <a name="edits"><a/>Making Edits

To make edits to the documents, navigate through the repository above and click through the chapter name and to the document that needs editing. Once you click on the document you would like to edit you will see on the top right hand corner a panel of options where one reads "Edit." Click on "Edit" to make modifications to the document.

You can work in full screen mode to make editing clearer and using bigger fonts.

To exit out of the full screen mode, click the *Exit Zen Mode* button on the top right hand corner.

## <a name="markdown"><a/>Markdown Format

In order to make the files editable through Indesign, the text had to be stripped out of MS Word's stylistic additions and formatting. Indesign assigns styles to text based on utility which is what this format does.

###Headings

All headings must be separated and removed from the body text in all situations. This will allow for dynamic cross linking, consistent styling of all headings and a clear hierarchy. Under no circumstances can a Heading be simply bolded or underlined, this will mean the Heading will not show up on the Table of Contents.

At this time, only three heading levels are selected to appear in the Table of Contents. Headings are denoted by placing "#" before the heading title. The more "#", the less important the heading:

```
#Heading Level 1    = Title of the Chapter
##Heading Level 2   = Major Chapter Section
###Heading Level 3  = Sub Heading
####Heading Level 4 = Minor Heading not in TOC

And so forth through Level 6
