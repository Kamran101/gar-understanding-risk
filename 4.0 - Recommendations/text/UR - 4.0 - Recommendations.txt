This publication has highlighted the remarkable progress made in understanding, quantifying, and communicating risk since 2005, when the Hyogo Framework for Action was endorsed. The array of projects and experiences described here for 40 countries demonstrates that no single approach to risk assessment is right in every case, and that the best risk assessments are those tailored to the context and identified need. At the same time, the recurrence of certain themes across the various projects makes it possible to start framing best practices and suggests some concrete recommendations for the next 10 years of risk assessment practice.

The recommendations we offer here draw on submissions to this publication as well as on discussions with both users and developers of risk information. For users of risk information—disaster risk management (DRM) practitioners, government officials, donors, and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs)—our key recommendations are designed to ensure that any investment in risk assessment promotes more resilient development and communities. For developers of risk information, we see an opportunity to promote greater transparency and accountability in the risk assessment process. We stress, however, that the best outcomes are likely to be achieved when those investing in risk information and those carrying out the risk analysis work in concert and share a common understanding of the undertaking.

## 1. Clearly define the purpose of the risk assessment before analysis starts. 
Too many risk assessments are implemented precipitously. These risk assessments—initiated without first defining a question to be answered and a specific end-user—often become scientific and engineering exercises that upon completion must find a use case and a purpose. Properly targeted assessments, on the other hand, suit their intended purpose and are not over-engineered or over-resourced. If a community seeks to understand the hazards it faces and to develop plans for evacuation, then mapping of exposure and natural hazards is a valid approach, but a different approach would be needed for financial planning or retrofitting design. Similarly, collecting detailed site-level construction information on selected buildings may be appropriate for the design of retrofitting measures, but this approach is not practical for a national-level risk assessment. 

Where risk assessments have been commissioned in response to a clear and specific request for information, they have tended to be effective in reducing fiscal or physical risk. Among the well-targeted risk assessments described in part 3 of this publication, we note here the following:

+ .__The Pacific Catastrophic Risk Assessment and Risk Financing Initiative (PCRAFI) (section 3-19)__. PCRAFI was designed to inform risk financing and insurance options, and ultimately to transfer risk to the international financial market. Given this purpose, the analysis had to conform to standards acceptable to the financial market. The first payout of the Pacific catastrophe risk pool in 2014 in Tonga is testament to the success of this project. An additional benefit of the project is that the data and analysis generated have been made available to all stakeholders to use for other purposes (for example, to determine how cyclone risk will change as climate change effects are increasingly felt; see section 3-24).
+ .__The assessment of seismic risk to Costa Rican water and sanitation systems (section 3-12)__. Costa Rican water and sanitation officials seeking to ensure continuation of services following an earthquake created the demand for this project. The development of the objectives, collection of data, and presentation of results were all aimed toward a very specific goal, and as a consequence resources and ultimately results were used efficiently.
+ .__Urban seismic risk mapping to inform DRM plans in Aqaba, Jordan (section 3-10)__. This project was initiated to manage the urban development expected in response to Aqaba’s being declared a special economic zone. The project supplied the evidence for an earthquake risk management master plan and served as the basis for an operational framework for earthquake risk reduction.

## 2. Promote and enable ownership of the risk assessment process and efforts to mitigate risk. 

A sense of ownership is critical to ensuring that knowledge created through a risk assessment is promulgated and acted upon. Countries, communities, and individuals must feel they have a stake in and connection to risk information if that information is to be used, especially by government. In many countries, if risk information is not seen as authoritative—if it is not understood to originate from government-mandated agencies—it will not be used in decision making. 

Risk information can be generated anywhere. Risk assessment specialists in London, for example, can generate risk information on flood in Pakistan. But extensive experience suggests that unless the Pakistan authorities have been actively engaged in the assessment process, the information produced, no matter how accurate or sophisticated, will have limited or no uptake and use. Engagement with official government stakeholders and local specialists—at the start of a risk assessment, through its implementation, and finally to its conclusion—is critical for the success of a DRM effort. 

Fortunately, as many of the projects described in part 3 make clear, the importance of ownership is increasingly being recognized:

+ .In Jordan, local scientific and government groups partnered with international and other development agencies to integrate seismic risk reduction considerations into Aqaba’s economic development (see section 3-10).  
+ .In Malawi, the government partnered with the World Bank and Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery to assess flood risk in the Shire River Valley as part of an effort to reduce entrenched poverty and make the valley a national economic hub (see section 3-14).
+ .In Peru, Technical Assistance Projects fostered a hands-on approach to generating, understanding, managing, and using risk information, and thus promoted ownership of the process and the results of the assessment (see section 3-12).  

The crucial role of ownership is also evident in the increasing part played by volunteers in collecting fundamental data used in risk assessments (such as through volunteered geospatial information, or crowdsourcing). Especially relevant case studies are described in sections 3-2, 3-3, and 3-4. This shift toward community participation reflects communities’ sense that they can contribute to understanding and mitigating the risk they face. Experience shows that governments and decision makers increasingly recognize the value and the potential of this approach, but consider it critical that the data are certified (for accuracy). In many cases governments would also like to harness volunteer efforts toward particular needs—for example, may wish to direct volunteers toward collecting information about buildings’ attributes (such as use, number of floors, vintage, and structural materials) rather than focusing on buildings’ location and footprint. Universities have shown themselves to be excellent partners in this type of volunteer data collection, and their participation assists with ownership and helps to ensure data’s scientific validity.

Partnerships designed to both produce risk information and build capacity—such as those between the government of Australia and various scientific/technical agencies in Asia and the Pacific (section 3-9), and between the World Bank and countries in Latin America and the Caribbean (section 3-12)—have also been an important means of promoting ownership. A number of elements go into assuring the success of these partnerships: high levels of trust developed over long periods of time; a focus on work that builds on existing capabilities and interests; and the involvement of credible, capable, and committed experts who understand the partner country’s systems and cultures, including its language.

## 3. Cultivate and promote the generation and use of open data. 
All the case studies featured in this publication make clear that the creation and use of open data should be encouraged.

A risk assessment that yields only a paper or PDF report is of limited use. Its relevance and appropriateness are of short duration, and few decision makers are likely to engage with it. A risk assessment that shares with stakeholders the data it has collected and improved, on the other hand, will have a much greater impact. The effort required to collect exposure information is substantial, but fortunately, the data sets produced have relevance and use for a range of DRM purposes as well as for urban and local planning. If all the input data sets and final results are made technically open, the broader community is able to engage through improvements in data and development of new applications and information for community awareness; and the private sector is able to access data that can improve its resiliency. Data sharing can also redound to the advantage of those who undertook the original assessment, because it allows new data to be exploited when they become available; this means that additional or new analysis is less of a drain on resources and takes less time than it otherwise would.

With respect to creation of new open data, our short experience is only beginning to speak to the immense potential of structured and unstructured volunteered geospatial information (section 3-3), better access to remote sensing data over wider areas (boxes 2-2 and 2-3), better ways of exploiting and integrating new exposure data sets and models (“Exposure” in part 2), and release of __technically__ open data sets by governments (section 3-3), the private sector, and NGOs.

It is clear from case studies and research that greater effort is needed to open up and improve damage and loss data collections to make them meaningful and useful for understanding and quantifying risk. An encouraging sign is a pilot being undertaken by the Insurance Bureau of Canada that will give cities access to flood insurance claims data, alongside municipal infrastructure data and current and future climate data on flood<sup>93</sup>—a significant step toward better understanding and managing urban flood risk.

Given the benefits it stands to gain, the global DRM community needs to be willing to press for greater access to fundamental data sets that quantify risk. Without access to higher-resolution digital elevation models, results for flood, tsunami, and storm surge inundation may be impossible to produce at the necessary resolution, or may be massively inaccurate. Similar gaps in fundamental data exist across all hazard areas, and these are hindering the development of robust and accurate information. In many cases the needed data already exist but are not accessible. If the DRM community comes together and advocates for these data to become technically open, access is likely to improve and data gaps to be closed.

## 4. Make better communication of risk information an urgent priority.
Clear communication throughout the risk assessment process, from initiation through delivery of the results and the development of plans in response, is critical for successfully mitigating disaster risk. 

A case study featured in section 3-21—“Build Back Better: Where Knowledge Is Not Enough”—is a must-read for all risk assessment practitioners and disaster risk managers who believe that exceptional communication of risk information is the key to preparedness and risk reduction. A massive “Build Back Better” campaign led by the government of Indonesia in the aftermath of the 2009 Padang earthquake demonstrates conclusively that well-targeted education and communication of risk information can increase awareness of natural hazards and their potential impacts. Analysis also shows, however, that progress from increased awareness to substantive action is very difficult to achieve, even in a community that has witnessed at first hand the devastation of an earthquake. The study finds overall that homeowners can be motivated to put risk knowledge into practice and build more resilient homes if they are offered the correct combination of timely information, technical training, community supervision, and financial and nonfinancial incentives and disincentives.

Some of the improvements that can be made in communicating risk at the subnational and city levels are evident in the InaSAFE project in Indonesia (section 3-22). Among the key partners in InaSAFE’s development were Indonesian authorities, who realized the need for interactive risk communication tools that could robustly and simply answer “what if?” questions. InaSAFE is demand driven, included user participation in its development, uses open data and an open model, and offers extensive graphical displays (provided by a GIS system) and an extensive training program. Communication was frequent and wide-ranging throughout the development of InaSAFE and continued during the collection of data, the use of the model, and the formation of response plans. The software has won awards and is being used in other countries, including the Philippines and Sri Lanka.

To build on this progress in communicating risk, significant investment and innovation will be needed in coming years.

## 5. Foster multidisciplinary, multi-institutional, and multi-sectoral collaborations at all levels, from international to community. 

Risk assessment is a multidisciplinary and multi-institutional effort that requires collaborations at many levels, from international, to national and subnational, down to the individual.

Generating a usable risk assessment product involves consultations among technical experts, decision makers, and disaster managers, who must reach agreement on the risk assessment’s purpose and process. Collaboration among technical disciplines, agencies, governments, NGOs, and virtual communities, as well as informal peer-to-peer exchanges and engagement with local communities, will help an effort succeed. 

This publication draws attention to a variety of collaborations that aim to build better risk information: 

+ .__The Global Earthquake Model__ brings together public institutions, private sector institutions (most notably insurance and reinsurance agencies), NGOs, and the academic sector, all with the goal of improving access to tools, data sets, and knowledge related to seismic risk (section 3-6).
+ .__The Willis Research Network__ initiative links more than 50 international research institutions to the expertise of the financial and insurance sector in order to support scientists’ quantification of natural hazard risk (box 2-12).
+ .__The Understanding Risk__ community of practice, made up of more than 3,000 practitioners from across all sectors in more than 125 countries, is creating new partnerships and catalyzing advances in understanding, quantifying, and communicating natural hazard risk (box 2-11). 
+ .__The Bangladesh Urban Earthquake Resilience Project__ is a platform for addressing urban risk that brings together officials in planning, governance, public service, and construction code development as well as scientists and engineers, and that fosters consensus on how to overcome institutional, legislative, policy, and behavioral barriers to a more earthquake-resilient city (box 2-13).

One key task of these and similar collaborations is reaching out to communities to build consensus, raise awareness, and promote action concerning the risks they face. Greater effort is needed to provide national- and subnational-level information on risk to community groups and NGOs working at the community level. Too often, organizations working within communities to increase preparedness and reduce risk lack access to this relevant risk information. Significant gains could arise from merging work being produced at national or subnational level with communities’ understanding of their risks and challenges—but this opportunity has as yet rarely been capitalized upon. 

## 6. Consider the broader risk context. 	

Rarely do countries, communities, or citizens face potential risks from only one hazard, or even from natural hazards alone. Our complex environments and social structures are such that multiple or connected risks—from financial hazards, multiple or cascading natural hazards, and anthropogenic hazards—are the norm. A risk assessment that accounts for just one hazard may struggle with relevance and will not necessarily speak to a decision maker who is responsible for broader risk management. Moreover, failure to consider the full risk environment can result in maladaptation: heavy concrete structures that protect against cyclone wind, for example, may be deadly in an earthquake.

Experience shows that the benefits of a multi-hazard risk approach include improvements in land-use planning, better response capacity, greater risk awareness, and increased ability to set priorities for mitigation actions. Such an approach also highlights the importance of partnerships generally and of multidisciplinary, multi-institutional, and multi-sectoral collaborations in particular. Examples of this approach showcased in this publication include projects in Maldives (section 3-13), Morocco (section 3-17), and Guadeloupe and Naples (section 3-20).

Decision makers need to exercise particular caution where risks in food security and the agricultural sector are concerned. Such risks should be considered at all times alongside flood and drought analysis. Food security–related risks such as animal and plant pests and diseases are important for many populations, yet they are not considered under the Hyogo Framework for Action. 

## 7. Keep abreast of evolving risk.

Risk assessments must be dynamic because risks themselves are always evolving. Assessments that estimate evolving or future risk allow stakeholders to act now to avoid or mitigate the risk they will face in the future. Getting ahead of risk is particularly important in rapidly urbanizing areas or where climate change impacts will be felt the most.

The evolution of meteorological hazard arising from climate change will likely occur slowly. The same is true for changes in hazard due to sea-level rise (for example, with higher sea levels, inundation from storm surge and tsunami events may reach further inland). That said, it is possible today—with varying levels of uncertainty—to estimate how climate change may affect losses from meteorological hazards such as cyclone; a case study described in section 3-24 examines how tropical cyclone patterns, altered by climate change, affect losses in 15 Pacific Island countries, assuming steady-state exposure. 

Given the intensive data needs involved, there have been few efforts to look at changing exposure and vulnerability, along with the resulting change in risk, in urban environments. While the contribution of urbanization to greater exposure is widely recognized, studies rarely consider how changes in urban construction practices affect building vulnerability—often for the worse. The case study of evolving seismic risk in Kathmandu offers an important example of this approach (section 3-25). The study shows that the incremental construction of houses in Kathmandu, where stories are added to buildings informally over time, has increased both exposure and vulnerability in the area. Using a single-scenario earthquake event, a reproduction of the 8.1 magnitude Bihar earthquake of 1934, the analysis finds that the potential number of buildings sustaining heavy damage or collapse in this event has increased from ~50,000 in 1990 to ~125,000 in 2010, and that it may be as high as 240,000 by 2020 if action is not taken. 

Considering global changes in hazard and exposure for flood offers some sobering statistics for the future: “middle-of-the-road” socioeconomic changes and climate change could increase riverine flood risk for between 100 million and 580 million people by 2050, depending on the climate scenario (see section 3-23). At a city level, changes in exposure and flood hazard for Dhaka, Bangladesh, were found likely to increase the average annual loss by a factor of 20 to 40. Moreover, while both climate change and socioeconomic development were found to contribute importantly to this increase in risk, the individual contribution of socioeconomic development is greater than that of climate change.

Coastal regions are especially dynamic, and—in light of future sea-level rise driven by local subsidence, the thermal expansion of the oceans, and melting of continental ice—need special consideration. Changes in sea level can be particularly important for relatively flat low-lying islands and coastlines, since a small change in sea level can affect huge areas. Even small changes can become extremely important during flood and storm surge events.

## 8. Understand, quantify, and communicate the uncertainties and limitations of risk information. 

Once risk information is produced, its users must be made aware of its limitations and uncertainties, which can arise from uncertainties in the exposure data, in knowledge of the hazard, and in knowledge of fragility and vulnerability functions. A failure to understand or consider these can lead to flawed decision making and a potential increase in disaster risk. A risk model can produce a very precise result—it may show, for example, that a 1-in-100-year flood will affect 388,123 people—but in reality the accuracy of the model and input data may provide only an order of magnitude estimate. Similarly, sharply delineated flood zones on a hazard map do not adequately reflect the uncertainty associated with the estimate and could lead to decisions such as locating critical facilities just outside the “flood line,” where the actual risk is the same as if the facility was located inside the flood zone. 

If risk information is to be useful in making communities more resilient and better able to manage risk, then the specialists who produce it must do more to clearly and simply communicate its uncertainties and limitations. Fortunately, some recent projects suggest that progress is being made in this regard: 

+ .In Kathmandu, assessment of damage to buildings as risk evolves over times includes a range of uncertainty (section 3-25). 
+ .In global risk models, the limitations for use in national and subnational risk reduction are clearly articulated (sections 3-7, 3-8, and 3-23).
+ .In Morocco, results of multi-hazard risk analysis are communicated using a range of different approaches (section 3-17).

## 9. Ensure that risk information is credible and transparent.
Risk information must be credible and transparent: scientifically and technically rigorous, open for review, and honest regarding its limitations and uncertainties. 

A risk assessment must be perceived as credible for it to be worth acting upon. The best way to demonstrate credibility is to have transparent data, models, and results open for review by independent, technically competent individuals. Equally important is the clear articulation of the assessments’ limitations. Several projects described in this publication found that data limitations and assumptions made in the modelling process could substantially change the end result:

+ .Multiple tsunami hazard maps were produced in Padang, Indonesia, by different institutions, each offering plausible information for decision makers, and each based on different approaches, assumptions, and data (see box 3-5). 
+ .Depending on the choice of elevation data in modelling tsunami hazard, inundation levels varied dramatically as a function of the digital elevation model used in the simulation (see box 2-4). 
+ .Different seismic hazard results for ground motion in Japan highlight the impact of the choice of attenuation function (see box 2-10).

These examples make clear the need for credible, scientific, and transparent modelling of risk. Every risk analysis should be accompanied by modelling metadata that articulate the data sets and modelling parameters used so that anyone can recreate identical results. In other words, we need to achieve an “academic level” of transparency. The selection of modelling parameters also speaks to the need for credible scientific and engineering inputs throughout the modelling process; in theory, anyone can run a risk model, but in reality, the absence of necessary scientific and engineering training can produce results that are fundamentally inaccurate and misleading.

## 10. Encourage innovations in open source software.

It is clear that immense progress has been made in the last 5 to 10 years in creating new open source hazard and risk modelling software. More than 80 open source software packages are currently available for flood, tsunami, cyclone (wind and surge), and earthquake, with at least 30 of these in wide use (see “Hazard and Risk Assessment Tools” in part 2). Moreover, significant progress has been made in improving open source geospatial tools, such as QGIS and GeoNode, which are lowering the financial barriers to understanding risks at national and subnational levels.

There is some tendency to assume that open source software may be less robust than commercial packages, may be less user-friendly, and may not offer technical support. But this assumption has little basis. Some of the most widely used packages, such as InaSAFE and TCRM, provide interactive help, and others, such as the Deltares-developed packages, have impressive graphical user interfaces that offer point-and-click capabilities. Available software packages range from those that meet the needs of entry-level users to those that are appropriate for advanced scientific and engineering analysis. Some tools offer single hazard and risk analysis—probabilistic and deterministic—and some, such as RiskScape and CAPRA, offer multi-hazard capabilities.

Increasing the uptake of open source modelling tools is an important challenge that will need to met in coming years. Among specific goals in this area are the following:  

+ .Access to software with user-friendly interfaces, simple single-click installation, and tutorials on software use should be increased. 
+ .Licensing restrictions on how software may be used or altered should be easier to understand.
+ .Access to model source code—through wiki-type systems—should be increased in order to provide improved transparency in how results are calculated, allow for customization and optimization of code, enable production of better code through multiple independent reviews, provide developers with an easy way to manage and update code, and offer users easy access to models.
+ .Standard model outputs and data (e.g., event loss tables) should be made viewable at every stage of the analysis without significant increases in processing. 
+ .Tools should have the capability of using custom exposure data and hence of handling both static risk and dynamic risk.
+ .Software should host a greater range of vulnerability functions capable of calculating vulnerability (susceptibility to damage or loss) using either empirical methods (historical trending of data) or analytical methods (mathematical or mechanical approach). These should cover both physical and social vulnerability. 
+ .Risk should be calculable not only for a building or building type, but also for a diverse portfolio of buildings and infrastructure, or in terms of the total economic loss for a city or region.

A great challenge for the next five years—one that has arisen rapidly along with innovative software models—involves “fitness-for-purpose,” interoperability, transparency, and standards. This challenge needs to be overcome in a way that continues to catalyze innovation and yet also better supports risk model users. But it is an institutional challenge, and not a technical one, and it can be met if model developers agree on minimum standards and build partnerships across institutions and hazard types.
