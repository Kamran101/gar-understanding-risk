## Writing in Markdown

Some changes had to be made in order to accommodate for some of the difficulties when converting markdown into text ready for Indesign. Specifically:

**BOLD** 					=> Use only double asterisks for indicating bold.
__Italicise__ 				=> Use only double underscores for indicating italics

1. .Numbered List 			=> Add a period before the first character of a numbered list.
+ .Bullet List 				=> Add a bullet before the first character of a bulleted list.

<blockquote>Text</blockquote> => Use this markup for block quotes
<sup>Text</sup> 		=> Use this text for superscripted text
<sub>Text</sub> 		=> Use this text for subscripted text
<br />						=> Use this for a soft break

*/ Text /* 					=> Use this for Author names for each section
// Text //					=> Use this for inline headings (Do not appear in TOC)

Keep an eye out for the following:
“” 							=> Typographer’s quotes do not work, replace "
‘’							=> Apostrophe’s do not work, replace with Prime '
&mdash;				=> Use this for when typing in an EM Dash (–)



## GREP Queries

When applying GREP queries, it is important to use the find and replace function.

### Setup
Place the XML GREP Query files into the appropriate folder so they can appear in Find / Change / Replace window in Indesign.
