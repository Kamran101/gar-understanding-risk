### The Importance of Accurate Elevation Data for Understanding Tsunami Hazard
Tsunami inundation models provide fundamental information about coastal areas that may be inundated in the event of a tsunami. This information has relevance for disaster management activities, including evacuation planning, impact and risk assessment, and coastal engineering. A basic input to tsunami inundation models is a digital elevation model—that is, a model of the shape of the onshore environment. Onshore DEMs vary widely in resolution, accuracy, availability, and cost. Griffin et al. (2012) assessed how the accuracy and resolution of DEMs translate into uncertainties in estimates of tsunami inundation zones. The results showed that simply using the “best available” elevation data, such as the freely available global SRTM elevation model, without considering data accuracy can lead to dangerously misleading results.The top part of the figure shows tsunami inundation models for the 1992 tsunami in Flores, Indonesia (Griffin et al. 2012). For each model all parameters are the same except for the elevation data, shown in the bottom of the figure. Inundation model results are overlain with field observations of the actual inundation.a LiDAR and airborne InSAR give inundation area extents that are comparable with historical data. However, results obtained using the SRTM data set, with lower vertical accuracy,b show negligible tsunami inundation. 
Two main inferences can be drawn from the results:1. .The most accurate and expensive data are not always needed, depending on the purpose. Airborne InSAR, which is an order of magnitude cheaper to acquire than LiDAR, may be suitable for tsunami evacuation planning.c 2. .SRTM and ASTERd data sets, although freely available with near global coverage, should not be used for modelling onshore tsunami hazard, since the results can be dangerously misleading. 
This study makes clear that accurate elevation models are crucial for understanding tsunami hazard. Investing in high-quality, accessible elevation data in tsunami-prone areas will underpin better risk reduction planning at the local level.

c. However, further testing of tsunami inundation sensitivity to underlying DEM may be required in other coastal environments with different geomorphology before this inference becomes a widespread recommendation.
d. ASTER elevation data also significantly underestimate the wet area. See Griffin et al. (2012) for the full analysis.
