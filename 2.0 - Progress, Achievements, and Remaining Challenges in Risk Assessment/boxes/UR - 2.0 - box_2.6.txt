### Indirect Characterization of Exposure
///Population:/// A global distribution of population data, in terms of counts or density per unit area, is considered the primary source of information for exposure assessment. For instance, the GAR13 exposure database uses the commercial global LandScan population database to obtain a spatial distribution of buildings’ structural types (de Bono 2013). Analogously, the GED4GEM database exploits population data to disaggregate exposure estimation (Dell’Acqua, Gamba, and Jaiswal 2012). In both cases the knowledge of the percentage of population living in each building type, or the estimated average dwelling occupancy, is used to link the population to the physical exposure. Global population models also allow use of empirical vulnerability functions, where direct estimates of loss are obtained directly in terms of population exposed, and the main loss metrics account for fatalities (Jaiswal and Wald 2010). Many global models use human exposure as a basic ingredient to define a more refined “hazard-specific exposure” (Dilley 2005; Peduzzi et al. 2009; Allen et al. 2009).
///Built-up areas:/// A further step with respect to population distribution is the spatial delineation of built-up areas, that is, impervious surfaces mostly characterized by artificial structures, including roads and buildings. Built-up areas are often described by binary masks that clearly outline the boundary of settlements. This can be considered an intermediate description of exposure, where the characterization of the built-up environment is improved with respect to a simple population layer. Built-up masks can be reliably obtained by processing different remote-sensing data, thus effectively addressing global-scale mapping. Examples of global built-up area products include the Global Rural-Urban Mapping Project (GRUMPv1),a the Global Human Settlement Layer (Pesaresi and Halkia 2012), and the Global Urban Footprint (GUF) (Esch et al. 2010).
