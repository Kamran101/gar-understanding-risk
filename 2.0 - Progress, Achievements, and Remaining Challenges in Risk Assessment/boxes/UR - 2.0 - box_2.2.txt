### Assessing Damage and Loss Caused by Drought: Example of a Deterministic Assessment
Most studies that evaluate drought damage look at past drought events on an ex post basis. They use self-reports or media accounts, or compare production for drought and non-drought years (Martin-Ortega and Markandya 2009). These ex post approaches may fail to determine susceptibility to drought, due to predefined relations between certain drought hazard and resistance parameters and expected damage. Moreover, they also fail to deal with the dynamics of drought risk and damage over time. Specific problems with these ex post approaches include potential bias from self-reports and media accounts of damage, and significant uncertainty in comparisons between drought and non-drought agricultural production. Additionally, these comparisons fail to account for factors other than drought that influence production. They do not distinguish between direct drought effects that damage crops and indirect effects spreading through the economy. A further problem with current drought damage models is that they are not designed to account for drought mitigation measures. This means that the damage-reducing effects of drought mitigation measures are largely unknown, a situation that makes choosing among the different mitigation measures difficult. This lack of information about mitigation strategies is especially problematic in the case of drought-related soil subsidence. Existing studies suggest that soil subsidence (which can severely damage buildings) can be as destructive as other large-scale natural disasters, such as floods, yet little is known about how best to reduce its impact.Deficiencies in current approaches to assessing damage and loss caused by drought could be ameliorated using the following:+ .Ex ante evaluation methods. Properly designed, these will help to address the projected increase in frequency and intensity of droughts, make it possible to learn about changes in drought damage over time, and facilitate evaluating and prioritizing mitigation strategies for drought damage. + .More sophisticated drought damage models that are based on assessments of losses to economic flows. These models account for indirect losses of sector-specific added value, wage losses, or relocation expenses and could significantly improve current cost assessments.+ .Models that capture the effect of drought mitigation measures. Existing databases on drought-induced soil subsidence and its effect on different building types could provide a basis for this future work.
