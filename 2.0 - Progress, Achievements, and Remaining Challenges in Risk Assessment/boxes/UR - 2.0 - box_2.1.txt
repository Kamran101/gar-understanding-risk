### Multi-Peril Risk Assessment: An Overview
In spite of growing interest in and use of multi-risk assessment approaches, devising an integrated multi-risk assessment scheme remains a major challenge. It implies adopting a quite different perspective from that of a classical single-risk analysis. A multi-risk analysis does not merely consider more than one type of risk. It deals with the various spatial and temporal interactions that may arise between risks (European Commission 2010). For example, cascading or domino effects may include cases in which one event directly triggers another (such as the 2011 Great East Japan earthquake, where the earthquake triggered a tsunami, and the ensuing tsunami resulted in catastrophic failures at the Fukushima nuclear facility). Cascading or domino effects may also include cases in which the occurrence of one event modifies the likelihood of another (such as drought and wildfires) and/or increases the vulnerability of an area to later events. There are also situations where more than one event may occur at around the same time, without any actual physical link (e.g., an earthquake just after a windstorm).  Another example of cascading effects from a hazard is combustion of a building by fire caused by an explosion of gas released from a pipeline ruptured by an earthquake. This scenario occurred following the 1994 Northridge earthquake, when approximately 110 earthquake-related fires were reported within 24 hours of the earthquake (Scawthorn 1997). A slightly different scenario occurred following the 1995 Kobe earthquake, when a similar number of fires ignited. Damage to structures from fire caused by the Northridge earthquake was well contained; however, nearly 5,500 buildings were lost to fire caused by the Kobe earthquake.
The results provided by a full multi-risk approach would need to include a harmonized quantitative assessment of the different risks and the effects of the possible interactions. Thus, while a multi-risk assessment may make it possible to establish a hierarchy of risks, it can also be used to identify areas where efforts to mitigate one hazard may conflict with, or create synergies with, the response of the system to a second type of hazard, or where planned adaptation and mitigation activities may potentially increase or decrease the risk from other hazards. An example of this potential risk is the challenge of building for cyclone wind and earthquake—wherein the strongest concrete building may decrease vulnerability in a cyclone, but create additional vulnerability in an earthquake (as happened in Haiti in 2010).
