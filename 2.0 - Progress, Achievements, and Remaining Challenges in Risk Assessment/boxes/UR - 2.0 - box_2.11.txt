### The Understanding Risk Community
Understanding Risk (UR) is an open and global community of experts and practitioners in the field of disaster risk assessment. UR community members include representatives of government agencies, the private sector, multilateral organizations, nongovernmental organizations, community-based organizations, research institutions, and academia. Every two years, the Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery convenes the UR Forum—a five-day event designed to showcase best practices and the latest technical know-how in disaster risk assessment. The forums provide organizations with the opportunity to highlight new activities and initiatives, build new partnerships, and foster advances in the field.
The first UR Forum, held in Washington, DC, in June 2010, was attended by 500 practitioners representing 41 countries. The goal of the forum was to showcase progress in the field of disaster risk assessment and to promote the sharing of ideas and the exchange of knowledge through a series of technical sessions led by experts. During the forum, the GEM held its annual outreach meeting, and Random Hacks of Kindness (RHoK)—a group that brings together software programmers to develop applications for DRM challenges—organized its first global hackathon.<sup>a</sup> Based on the success of the forum, the UR series was launched.
UR 2012, held in Cape Town from July 2 to July 6, was attended by 500 risk assessment experts from more than 86 countries. The forum showcased new tools for decision makers, strengthened regional and global partnerships, and built technical capacity in the Africa region through a series of training events. UR 2012 was also a testimony to the tremendous progress in understanding risk since 2010: crowdsourcing, a new topic in 2010, by 2012 was being mainstreamed and used to support risk assessment for financial applications intended to make governments, businesses, and households more financially resilient to risk. A consensus about the need for data that are more open also emerged, with many initiatives demonstrating that the trend toward open data would be broadly beneficial. The forum also highlighted new tools and methodologies for building resilience, and in particular called attention to the extent to which these tools are now available to nonspecialists. As a result of the 2012 UR Forum, participatory mapping projects have been implemented in Nepal and Malawi, and open geospatial data platforms have been launched in the Horn of Africa, Haiti, and Sri Lanka. The 2012 forum also lead to the first national UR event, held in Brazil in November 2012. This event brought together Brazilian experts and practitioners to discuss the challenges the country faces in understanding its disaster risk and to raise the profile of the topic nationally. In May 2014, Haiti will hold a national UR Forum to bring together nontraditional partners and tackle the challenge of economic, social, and environmental vulnerability in the country.The next global UR Forum, in London between June 30 and July 4, 2014, takes “Producing Actionable Information” as its theme; it will focus on how to translate and communicate scientific information into actionable decisions on the ground. UR 2014 will continue to foster the growth of partnerships and spur the advances in risk assessment needed for achieving sustainable development and building resilience. The UR Forums are clearly meeting a need. Participants report that the mix of backgrounds, interests, and types of expertise they encounter, along with the opportunity to share ideas and information, stimulate their thinking and promote creative solutions to problems. Discussions taking place at the forums are being shared beyond the UR community by means of a post-conference publication (Understanding Risk: Best Practices in Disaster Risk Assessment). The UR community website (www.understandrisk.org) also serves as a platform for incubating innovation and forging partnerships in the disaster risk assessment field. Membership in the community has grown from about 1,000 in 2010 to more than 3,000 in 2014.a.
