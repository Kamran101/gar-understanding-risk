### Training in Use of Risk Models: The GEM PerspectiveWhile specific risk modelling software packages may be more or less appropriate depending on the experience level of the end-user, users at any level may benefit from training. It is important for users of hazard and risk models to understand the sensitivity of the models they are using and to be aware of the large impact on assessment results that changes in the input parameters can have. The figure shows that the OpenQuake engine may produce two different hazard maps for Japan depending on the user-defined modelling decisions (in this case related to the probability of a Tohoku-like event occurring in the next 50 years).
Training could be most beneficial in governments of developing countries, where capacity in conducting seismic hazard and risk assessment, using probabilistic modelling, and understanding results tends to be especially low and sporadic. But even governments in developed countries need access to technical advice, including the expertise of their own specialists.
The Global Earthquake Model has developed a variety of approaches to training users in its tools. It holds workshops targeted to users at the same level of experience and education, and it hosts professionals at the GEM secretariat for hands-on training that may last for weeks or months. For local experts in developing countries, GEM has found that “learning by doing” has been the most effective way to gain necessary skills and to develop needed capacity. Offering training of this type requires a few years of ongoing engagement and is possible only through strong partnerships at both the institutional and individual levels. Through its Earthquake Model for the Middle East (EMME) project, for example, GEM offered local technical experts their first exposure to probabilistic earthquake modelling. Although hazard and risk assessments might initially develop more slowly under the “learning by doing” approach, the newly built local capacity for maintaining, understanding, and advising governments is invaluable.
