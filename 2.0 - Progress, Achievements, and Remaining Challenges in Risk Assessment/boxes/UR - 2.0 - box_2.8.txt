### The Uses of Loss Inventories 
The terms “loss” and “damage” are often used interchangeably in reference to the adverse impacts of disasters on society, economies, and the environment. In the context of disaster loss inventories, losses are quantifiable measures expressed in either monetary terms (e.g., market value, replacement value) or counts such as number of fatalities and injuries. Damage is a generic term without quantitative characteristics, which does not mean that damage cannot be measured and expressed as a loss. The damage to a roof, for instance, can be translated into monetary terms (the cost of repairs), which in turn can be included in loss inventories.
Loss inventories are tools of accountability and transparency for DRM. Despite their shortcomings (such as quality issues), they provide a process for documenting a country’s disaster losses. Loss inventories establish an historical baseline for monitoring the level of impact on a community or country. They make it possible to quantify the impact of individual hazards so that communities can focus disaster risk reduction efforts on frequently occurring hazards rather than the last disaster. Inventories allow governments to allocate resources by community or by hazard—that is, to prioritize areas of heightened risk (hot spots) or to focus on a particular hazard. 
Loss information can also be harnessed for, and integrated into, risk assessments as part of efforts to promote community resilience. Loss and hazard profiles can inform land-use planning, zoning, and development decisions; local ordinances on building codes and housing density; taxation and budget decisions; and policy setting at local to national levels. A sound understanding of the drivers and causes of losses, as well as their societal, environmental, and economic implications, enables communities to manage hazards and disasters proactively rather than reactively.
Where loss inventories are consistently updated, the expanded historical record provides the basis for temporal studies and trend analysis of losses. High-quality loss data of good temporal and spatial resolutions can be coupled with ancillary data like DRM expenditures or demographic information. Combining these data makes it possible to evaluate the effectiveness of policies and to determine whether DRM expenditures are making a difference in loss trends, whether DRM efforts are effective, whether the mere presence of more people is driving the rise in losses, and whether climate change is affecting losses.
