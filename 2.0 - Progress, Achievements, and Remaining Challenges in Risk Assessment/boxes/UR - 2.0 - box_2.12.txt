### Willis Research Network
The Willis Research Network was launched in 2006 to better integrate science, insurance, and resilience.<sup>a</sup> Starting with a partnership of seven UK universities, the network has now grown to include more than 50 international research institutions, making the Willis Research Network one of the world’s largest collaborations between science and the financial sector.  The network’s research program is organized across four pillars: economic capital and enterprise risk management; natural hazard and risk; man-made liability risks; and core technologies and methods. A focus on accurately quantifying natural hazard risk is a priority for Willis Re and the insurance sector as a whole, given that the solvency capital of most non-life insurance companies is strongly influenced by their exposure to natural catastrophe risk.Research supported by the network has resulted in hundreds of peer-reviewed academic articles; it has also led to improved insurance sector models, methodologies, and transactions that enable the financial market to better understand and cover risk. Moreover, by openly sharing research findings, the network has made it possible for other private and public institutions to improve their efforts to identify, evaluate, and manage disaster risk.The Willis Research Network’s principles and practices—its clear articulation of critical research requirements, its protection of academic and scientific independence, and its recognition of the time frames consistent with academic achievement—explain its ability to catalyze improvements in risk assessment, and exemplify the strengths of academic and private sector partnerships.a. The network was formed to support the academic and analysis focus of Willis Group Holdings.__Source:__ Willis Research Network website (www.willisresearchnetwork.com), ©Willis Group Holdings.
