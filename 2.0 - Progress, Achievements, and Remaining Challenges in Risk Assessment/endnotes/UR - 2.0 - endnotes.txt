A 100-year event represents something with a probability of occurrence equal to 0.01 per year. In general, an X-year event has a 1/X probability of occurrence per year. The number of years represented by X is termed the “X-year return period.”

Information on the moment tensors for all earthquakes globally with moment magnitudes greater than 5 can be obtained through the Global Centroid-Moment-Tensor (CMT) Project (http://www.globalcmt.org). Best-track information for tropical cyclones includes the location (latitude and longitude), central pressure, and maximum sustained wind at six-hour intervals for all tropical cyclones. A collection of these data from a variety of sources can be obtained from the IBTrACS archive (http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/ibtracs/).

For a more in-depth discussion of how climate extremes may change in the future, see IPCC (2012).The discussion of exposure here draws heavily on two GAR15 input papers, both available at www.preventionweb.net/gar: Massimiliano Pittore, Marc Wieland, and Kevin Fleming, “From Remote Sensing to Crowdsourcing: Perspectives of a Global, Dynamic Exposure Model for Georisk Assessment” and Rashmin Gunasekera, Christoph Aubrecht, Oscar Ishizawa, and Sergio Freire, “Global Exposure Modelling: An End-User Perspective.” Many global exposure models make use of commercial available data sets such as LandScan (http://web.ornl.gov/sci/landscan/) and as a result the final exposure model may not be completely open.

This section provides an overview of the results in Daniell (2014).
