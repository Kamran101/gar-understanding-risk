## Vulnerability and Loss
Vulnerability is typically described in terms of damage and/or loss. Damage and loss to a structure are assessed using functions that relate hazard intensity to damage; see figure 2-2 for an illustration. Various adjectives are used to describe the functions, including “fragility,” “damage,” and “vulnerability.” Engineers use fragility functions to quantify damage and vulnerability functions to quantify loss caused by a hazard. However, it is not uncommon to use the term vulnerability function when discussing damage. Damage is often quantified using a damage ratio where 0 is equivalent to no damage and 1 is equivalent to complete destruction. Multiplying value by the damage ratio gives an estimate of direct loss. 

The resolution of loss estimates will vary by model. For a global- or regional-scale model, the losses may resolve only total direct loss, whereas detailed site-specific models may estimate loss to a structure, its contents, and outlying buildings and include time-dependent losses such as business interruption. Site-specific fragility and vulnerability functions can account for differences in structural characteristics, such as roof covering and how it is attached. Loss estimates for contents, business interruption, and outlying structures tend to be just a simple function of loss to the main structure. Fatality estimates tend to be based on knowledge of local population and empirical relationships based on structural damage or hazard characteristics. For example, PAGER estimates fatality rates based on ground-shaking intensity and a region-specific fatality rate (Jaiswal and Wald 2010). A somewhat similar approach is used for floods, where the fatality rate is a function of flood depth (Boyd et al. 2010).

Generally, functions are defined using mean values and a coefficient of variation (CV) for a range of hazard intensities (three-second gust wind speed at 5km/hr intervals, peak ground acceleration at intervals of 0.1g, flood depth at 50cm intervals, etc.) The CV tends to decrease with more information. For example, a relatively precise (small CV) estimate of damage would be expected if one had a vulnerability function that accounted for the structural details of a building designed and built to withstand the expected hazard intensities. The damage estimate would have considerable uncertainty (large CV) if the structure were part of aggregate occupancy data. An alternative to a function that provides a mean and a CV is to use a damage probability matrix.

Methods of assessing damage vary greatly depending upon the type of exposure under consideration (e.g., people, buildings, livestock), the resolution of the exposure information (e.g., site specific or aggregate data at postal code resolution or lower), and the details available for a given resolution (e.g., whether just occupancy is known or detailed structural information is available). In addition, the choice of whether to use a mean value or a sampled value for damage depends on the details of a risk analysis. A sampled value is generated using the mean and CV from the vulnerability function at the requisite hazard intensity. Other factors that can be incorporated into damage and loss estimates include when the structure was built, given that building practices and codes have changed over time, and the timing of an event, given that the use of a structure varies over the course of a day. 
Often losses are adjusted for a variety of additional factors, such as having to replace a structure if damage exceeds a certain threshold; accounting for business interruption costs for commercial or industrial properties or additional living expenses for residential properties; incorporating the effects of demand surge on large or sequential disasters; and including damage to a structure’s contents. A good overview of loss calculations is provided in section 3-18.

Losses can be estimated ex ante and ex post. Modelled losses often differ from observed losses for a variety of reasons. One reason is that modelled losses represent only losses that are captured by the model, and these losses depend upon the quality (in terms of resolution and detail) of the exposure data. Another reason is that loss inventories are typically collected in an ad hoc manner. Better records of disaster losses would provide a range of benefits (see box 2-8).

The historical record of loss mainly represents direct tangible losses produced by an event. Examples of direct tangible loss include damage to public and private infrastructure, commercial and industrial facilities, dwellings, and the contents of a structure. The cost of business interruption and the expense of housing a structure’s inhabitants while a dwelling is repaired or replaced are considered indirect losses. Indirect losses generally arise from disruptions in the flow of goods and services, though such disruptions can produce positive as well as negative impacts. An example of a positive impact would be the increased demand for construction material. In contrast to tangible losses that are relatively easy to value, such as damage to structures or contents, intangible losses are associated with assets that are difficult to value. Examples include the loss of a life, damage to ecosystem services, and damage to sites related to cultural heritage. (Box 2-9 describes efforts to increase the resilience of heritage sites in Bhutan.) A full consideration of all direct, indirect, and intangible losses would produce much higher loss estimates than the more easily quantified and commonly seen records of direct loss.

It can be difficult to anticipate and quantify the potential for indirect losses despite their size. The 2011 Tohoku earthquake and tsunami in Japan and flooding in Thailand offer an example of the global indirect impacts from local events. The Japanese tsunami was much more spectacular and had dramatic news coverage; however, the Thailand floods caused much more damage to industrial supply chains on a global basis.

The 2011 Tohoku earthquake and tsunami slowed the Japanese and global economies. For the full year of 2011 the gross domestic product (GDP) of Japan was 0.7 percent lower than in 2010 (Trésor-Economics 2012). The largest quarterly decline (1.8 percent) occurred in the first quarter when the earthquake and tsunami struck. There was a rebound in the third quarter followed by a decline in the fourth quarter that was associated with the Thailand floods. On a global basis there was negligible impact on full-year GDP because of a rebound in the second half of 2011. In addition, spending on public sector reconstruction resulted in a positive impact in 2012. 

In contrast to the Japanese disaster, the 2011 flooding in Thailand was estimated to have reduced global production by 2.5 percent (UNISDR 2012) and reduced Thailand’s GDP growth rate from 4.0 percent to an expected 2.9 percent (World Bank 2012b). The reason Thailand’s flooding had such a dramatic impact on the global economy is that industrial parks outside of Bangkok were a critical node in the global supply chain for the production of automobiles and electronics (Haraguchi and Lall 2013). 

As box 2-8 suggests, collecting and analyzing damage and loss data from previous disasters provides valuable insight into the understanding of physical, social, and economic vulnerability. Collecting information post-disaster can build damage scenarios to inform planning processes, assess the physical and financial impact of disasters, develop preparedness measures, and facilitate dialogue for risk management. A number of global and national disaster loss systems, some open and some proprietary, record the losses associated with disasters; these are listed in table 2-3.
